                                <p>As a student, I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to learn under Miss Foo, an industrial UX Consultant about UX Design. I embarked on the journey of completing this UX project from May to August 2020 and I am glad
                                    that I was able to learn along the way. This is my first UX Case Study and my task is to identify and improve the aesthetic issues and user experience of Avenaire.com.</p>

                                <h4>About Avenaire</h4>
                                <br> Avenaire is a Software-as-a-Service platform that enables event planners to find and collaborate with freelancers, while it allows freelancers to showcase skillsets, search for projects, manage schedules and utilize
                                its payment system.

                    <h4>The Challenges</h4>
                    <p> The first time when I tried to use the platform, there were many moments that I had no clue what to do next. Hence, I decided to improve the onboarding experience and service creation for freelancers, because these are the two most
                        basic user flows which are essential for expanding userbase for the business. </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>The Process</h4>
                    <p>I made use of double diamond design process, which includes:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Discovery</li>
                            <li>Definition</li>
                            <li>Development</li>
                            <li>Delivery</li>
                        </ol>
                        <img src="images/Double Diamond.png" alt="KeyChanges1">
                        <p>Since this is an individual project, I conducted initial user research and worked on user flows, visual design, and information architecture. After creating the prototype, the designs were evaluated through usability testing. The
                            prototype is then reiterated over and over after receiving feedback.</p>

                        <p>
                            Aside from my own experience using the platform, many interviewees gave feedback that the user flow is unintuitive. There are spaces of improvement to update the design patterns as well. Below are some of the key screens to highlight the issues.

                        <h4>User Research: User Interview and Survey</h4>
                        <p>
                            I wanted to learn about how people use different freelancing websites, how they feel about them, and how they offer their services on the platform. I created a survey completed by 43 participants, followed by video interviews with a few target users.
                            The survey was great for quickly collecting quantitative information and I used it as a way to identify potential participants for interviews (as one of the questions was asking if a target user is willing to be interviewed).
                            The interviews allowed me to gain more quality insights for how users behave on freelancing platforms and help to identify their concerns.

                            I made use of the SWOT analysis to develop deeper understanding and learn from other trending freelancing platforms. This may help us to discover more factors in making business decisions while we are redesigning the user flows.

                            After gaining insights from users and doing competitor analysis, I used Affinity Mapping to group the findings from previous researches.

                        <p>The key findings are as below:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Harsh competition on freelancing platforms</b><br>
                                    <p>Interviewees felt that it is increasingly difficult to stand out in online freelancing websites as there is an oversupply of freelancers and it is challenging for potential customers to gauge how good they are. As most
                                        of the customers solely based on the number of reviews as their deciding factor, it is more challenging for freelancers to sell their services, especially if they are new with no or minimal reviews.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Features that showcase their expertise</b><br>
                                    <p>In order to stand out among the competition, freelancers desire to have platforms designed to better display their work and experience. We can discover new ways to improve the features and information architecture of
                                        current freelancing platforms. </p>

                                    <p>Despite freelancers understand that their profiles are important, they still feel that it is very troublesome to go through various procedures in order to sell their services on most freelancing websites. We may want
                                        to identify the key information needed to display in the profile, and try to simplify the setup process.</p>

                        <p>
                            Before moving on to development and prototyping, I went to study user flows of different websites like Freelancer.com, Fiverr and LinkedIn that may be helpful in this project. Not only that I want to learn about their strengths and shortcomings in terms
                            of usability, but I also want to create some similar design patterns to facilitate user experience, as stated by Jakob’s Law. I developed both onboarding and service creation flows that allow for more intuitive user experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>In this redesigned flow, users have to complete short onboarding forms in order to complete their profiles. After logging in, the user is directed to job listing page instead to allow quicker search for new job opportunities.

                            I redesigned the homepage, navigation bar, footer, and other screens related to onboarding flow and service creation flow. This is to define and build a better design system and stronger identity for this freelancing website.

                            After the prototype was finished, it underwent usability testing to evaluate its usability. 5 participants took part in this testing and they were requested to perform two tasks: signing up for an account and creating a service. The majority of participants
                            were able to complete all tasks given but they think that font size is the main issue in term of design. The profile section received positive feedbacks because of its design and information architecture. After receiving feedbacks
                            from the participants, below are some of the key changes made.

                            Working on this project has been such a great experience. I have gained a lot understanding about UX design process, UX laws, UI components, usability heuristics, information architecture and design system. I cannot express enough gratitude for my mentor,
                            Miss Foo for her dedication and altruism, since I have learnt a lot from her despite doing self-study at the same time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Coming from Information Engineering and Media as my background, I had always spent more time focusing on web development, learning about programming languages and frameworks. It is very interesting to work on this project as I can connect between UI/UX
                            design and front-end development. The knowledge in front-end development will be very helpful in making decisions on using UI elements during the design process, whereas the understanding of UX Design will be very valuable
                            in communication with designers as a developer in the future.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I look forward to doing more case studies, in order to improve my sense of design and learn more about UX research.
