                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>As students from NTU, many of us have experienced the drawbacks of safety measures due to COVID-19, and took great interest in easing the circumstances for our peers and ourselves. Therefore, we decided to look into these issues and
                        try to offer a meaningful solution towards online learning.</p>
                    <p>One of the main problems identified was the difficulty of holding group study sessions due to the physical limitations brought on by social distancing, since fellow peers were often not in school and public spaces have been made less
                        available to prevent overcrowding.</p>
                    <p>With considerations to the tight working schedule and risk of working on something beyond our expertise, we decided to use a more efficient method of integrating a third-party app to fulfil the app’s needs. Since we want users to be
                        able find a study group and proceed to study with them online, we decided to utilise the API of the popular app, Zoom, to facilitate the use of video chat and screen sharing functions within the StudyBee app. </p>
                    <p>The key idea is to create an online community for fellow students to study together. The app included key features like:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lobby List</li>
                            <li>Zoom Call</li>
                            <li>Friends Feature</li>
                            <li>Quick Join</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>My role in this project</h2>
                    <p>
                        My main roles in this project are front-end development and User Interface/ User Experience (UI/UX) Design. In addition, I helped to integrate different parts of the application by the rest of team (primarily front-end and user interface). I contributed
                        consistently throughout the project and committed meaningful and significant amount of codes for the application on Github.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Early Planning and Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>During the early stage of the project, the team had to decide on user flows and navigation pathways to ensure the best user experience. Me and another team member initiated to do design prototypes to visualize the ideas. The two of
                        us used Figma and Adobe XD to create interactive wireframes and prototypes, and we also came up with the visual design of application. This prototype is used in demonstration in the first presentation.</p>
                    <h2>Overall UI Design and front-end development</h2>
                    <p>I am in charge of the overall UI for the application and my scope ranges from motion layouts, Java programming (for CRUD operations), animations (for Splash and Home Activities) to icon designs needed for specific screens.
                    </p>
                    <p>I wrote the XML and Java for Splash screen and reworked on UI of all the other screens, including Login, Home, Quick Join, Profile, Zoom API, etc. Most of the XML layouts had to be rewritten to ensure consistency and the quality of
                        overall design and all of the screens were used in the final application. Since I was working on overall UI, I had to go through and understand all the codes written by other group members, to ensure usability and keep wanted features.
                        I implemented many front-end development tools like the usage of fragmentation, adapters, motion layouts and also Java functions like Toast to create instances of visuals or texts. The images below act as examples to illustrate
                        the difference after the rework on the screens. After the update, the upcoming meetings dynamically retrieve data from database and show in home screen.</p>
                    <p>I made use of Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to edit some icons, and also helped to improve our logo. In addition, the logo was incorporated to become icon launcher for the application. </p>
                    <h2>Fragmentation feature </h2>
                    <p>Before the team started using Github, I was helping out Jiangxiao and Songyu for the integration of the mobile application. I primarily focused on integrating the fragmentation feature and fragments are heavily used in our mobile application
                        because the main navigation pathway for users is the bottom navigation bar. Most of the layouts like “Home”, “Quick join” and “Profile” were integrated together in the forms of fragments (Java and XML) which allow better transitions
                        in contrast to separate screens. The integration was very time consuming, as we had to fix issues and bugs within individual screens contributed by teammates. After the team started to use Github, I began to rework on UI for almost
                        all of the screens.</p>
